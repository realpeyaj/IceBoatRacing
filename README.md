## ❄️ What does it do?

**IceBoatRacing**, now with a full GUI system, Map Voting, Ghost Time Trials, Spectator Mode, and custom Particle Trails. Admin setup is easier than ever with the new in-game guide book.

### ✨ Key Features

* 🏔️ **Multi-Arena Support**
    * Run multiple races simultaneously on different tracks (e.g., "FrostyPeaks", "LavaRun").
* 🏁 **Flexible Race Modes**
    * Supports both **DEFAULT** (Sprint/Point-to-Point) and **LAP** (Looping) modes.
* ⚡ **Ray-Traced Physics**
    * Uses vector math to detect checkpoints even at extreme speeds (**100km/h+**). No more "skipping" checkpoints due to server lag.
* 🪄 **Visual Editor**
    * An innovative Wand tool (`/race admin wand`) to build tracks. Visualize spawns, checkpoints, and finish lines as floating particles in real-time.
* 📊 **Live Leaderboard**
    * Flicker-free sidebar scoreboard showing live ranks, speed, and lap times, plus an Action Bar speedometer.
* 🎵 **Immersive Audio**
    * Plays custom resource pack sounds/music during the race loop.
